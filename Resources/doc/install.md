Installing CCDNComponent CommonBundle
=====================================

## Dependencies:

No depedencies for this bundle.

## Installation:

Installation takes only 2 steps:

1. Download and install dependencies via Composer.
2. Register bundles with AppKernel.php.

### Step 1: Download and install dependencies via Composer.

Append the following to end of your applications composer.json file (found in the root of your Symfony2 installation):

``` js
// composer.json
{
    // ...
    "require": {
        // ...
        "codeconsortium/ccdn-component-common-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

NOTE: Please replace ``dev-master`` in the snippet above with the latest stable branch, for example ``2.0.*``.

Then, you can install the new dependencies by running Composer's ``update``
command from the directory where your ``composer.json`` file is located:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar update
```

### Step 2: Register bundles with AppKernel.php.

Now, Composer will automatically download all required files, and install them
for you. All that is left to do is to update your ``AppKernel.php`` file, and
register the new bundle:

``` php
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        new CCDNComponent\CommonBundle\CCDNComponentCommonBundle(),
        // ...
    );
}
```

### Translations

If you wish to use default texts provided in this bundle, you have to make sure you have translator enabled in your config.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml

framework:
    translator: ~
```

## Next Steps.

Installation should now be complete!
